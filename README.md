# Into the Clownverse

Welcome to Clown College, You have worked tirelessly to get here and are ready to begin your journey to become the Funniest Clown. But when you arrive things seem... off. An oddly unfunny haze has covered the campus, there is a dark hue to it. It seems that the professors of the prestigious Clown College have been corrupted by an entity known as the Void Clown. Their laugh-force is being siphoned to the anti-clown world. You remain uncorrupted and you need to purify them and restore their laughter.

Game developed for GameJam 2024 at Dalhousie University using the Unity engine.
